InnerDuel Shared Source & Intellectual Property Notice

1. The Spirit of the Project
InnerDuel is a labor of love born from an obsession with Neuro-psychology and the IFS framework. While we are currently a closed-source SaaS to ensure the project's sustainable growth, we believe in logic transparency. We share our frameworks and documentation here to invite dialogue, not just to set boundaries.

2. Intellectual Property & Ownership
All intellectual property rights—including the IDT (Inner Duel Type) neuro-personality classification system, the 5-Member Council framework (comprising the L, D, S, T, and B archetypes), neural-mapping algorithms, and all cyberpunk-styled visual assets—remain the exclusive property of Grey Chan's Lab LLC.

The unique synthesis of neurobiological profiles and the "Inner Council" personas is a proprietary methodology designed to revolutionize personal decision-making and cognitive harmony. Unauthorized use, reproduction, or redistribution of these frameworks is strictly prohibited.

3. Permitted & Restricted Use
For Personal & Research Use: We encourage you to study our logic and discuss the framework. If you find our psychological mapping useful, feel free to cite InnerDuel in your non-commercial research.

Commercial Restrictions: Redistribution, sub-licensing, or the creation of derivative SaaS products based on the InnerDuel framework/source code is strictly prohibited without prior written consent.

No Reverse Engineering: You may not decompile or attempt to derive the source code for the purpose of cloning the InnerDuel service.

4. "Open Logic" Collaboration
We don't want this to be a one-way street. We warmly invite you to:

Submit Issues for logic optimization or feature requests.

Collaborate on the psychological methodology behind the Council.

Reach out for official API access or partnership inquiries if you wish to build atop our ecosystem.

5. Disclaimers
As-Is: This project is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.

Non-Medical: InnerDuel is a cognitive support tool. It is not a substitute for professional medical or mental health advice.
