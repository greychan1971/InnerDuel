# InnerDuel.ai : Map your brain. Duel your REAL LIFE.

## 💡 Project Overview : My "Mind Lab" Manifesto

Hey, I'm Grey. Welcome to InnerDuel.ai.

Ever feel like your brain is a chaotic boardroom where everyone is screaming at once, and somehow, the worst idea always wins?

I got tired of the noise. So, I built IDT (Inner Duel Type) — a neuro-based personality system. This isn't your average "which-pizza-topping-are-you" quiz. I’ve mapped out 12 unique cognitive profiles based on how our brains actually handle internal conflicts.

The Mission: Most people are burnt out because they’re trying to run software that isn't compatible with their brain’s hardware. In InnerDuel, I help you identify your specific IDT profile. Once you have your "Brain Operating Manual," everything changes:

No More Decision Fatigue: You’ll finally know which voice in your "Inner Council" should hold the gavel.

Life on Your Terms: You’ll start organizing your days based on your neural strengths, not someone else’s hustle culture.

I’m here to help you move from "survival mode" to "flow state." It’s about using tech and neuroscience to find that sweet spot of true harmony and effortless joy.

## 🏛 The Inner Council Members
Each persona represents a specific neural or psychological function:

L.D.S.T.B.

* **Alpha (Logic)**: The Rational Planner. Focuses on data-driven strategy and long-term consequences (Prefrontal Cortex).
* **Dominic (Desire)**: The Motivation Seeker. Driven by novelty and potential gains (Nucleus Accumbens).
* **Lilith (Safety)**: The Impulse Warner. Detects risks and prioritizes immediate safety (Amygdala).
* **Augustus (Tradition)**: The Keeper of Experience. Analyzes past patterns to inform present choices (Hippocampus).
* **Serena (Bond)**: The Emotional Moderator. Ensures cognitive harmony and prevents burnout (Serotonin System).

## 🎨 Visual Methodology
This repository hosts original high-fidelity infographics and character assets for the InnerDuel ecosystem. These assets bridge the gap between neurobiological concepts and intuitive user interface design.

## 🚀 Responsive Experience
The project features a tailored UI:
* **Desktop**: A cinematic Hero Image visualizing the council in session.
* **Mobile**: An accessible, detailed card-list for each council member.
