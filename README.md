## 💡 Project Overview
InnerDuel is a structured cognitive framework designed to visualize the "internal debate" within the human mind. By personifying complex psychological functions into a **6-member Inner Council**, we empower users to navigate difficult decisions with clarity, logic, and emotional balance.

## 🏛 The Inner Council Members
Each persona represents a specific neural or psychological function:

* **Alpha (Logic)**: The Rational Planner. Focuses on data-driven strategy and long-term consequences (Prefrontal Cortex).
* **Lilith (Warning)**: The Impulse Warner. Detects risks and prioritizes immediate safety (Amygdala).
* **Dominic (Reward)**: The Motivation Seeker. Driven by novelty and potential gains (Nucleus Accumbens).
* **Augustus (Memory)**: The Keeper of Experience. Analyzes past patterns to inform present choices (Hippocampus).
* **Serena (Balance)**: The Emotional Moderator. Ensures cognitive harmony and prevents burnout (Serotonin System).
* **The Self (The Decider)**: The conscious core that integrates all perspectives into a final verdict.

## 🎨 Visual Methodology
This repository hosts original high-fidelity infographics and character assets for the InnerDuel ecosystem. These assets bridge the gap between neurobiological concepts and intuitive user interface design.

## 🚀 Responsive Experience
The project features a tailored UI:
* **Desktop**: A cinematic Hero Image visualizing the council in session.
* **Mobile**: An accessible, detailed card-list for each council member.
